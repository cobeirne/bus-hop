# Bus Hop

Bus Hop is a web application that provides bus stop departure information to public transport users.  It also accepts GPS location updates via a RESTFUL API for real time bus tracking functions.  This was a team Deakin University Capstone Project for which I was the main programmer.

Some of the key technical achievements include:
* Bootstrap MVC web application with integrated RESTFUL API.
* Public Transport Victoria (PTV) API integration – bus route & schedule queries.
* Google API integration – auto address, geolocation, direction and map functions.
* Estimated Departure Algorithm – best guest based on bus GPS location data.

The project is now at the prototype stage of development and is ready for beta testing.
